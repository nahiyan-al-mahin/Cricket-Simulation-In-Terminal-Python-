# 🏏 Cricket Simulation in Terminal (Python)

A **terminal-based cricket match simulation** built using Python.  
This project simulates a full cricket match between two teams with a toss, batting, bowling, player runs, wickets, and match results — all displayed in the terminal.

## 📌 Project Overview

This program generates a **randomized cricket match** where:
- Two teams are entered by the user
- A toss decides who bats first
- Each team plays one innings
- Players score runs until they get out
- The match result is displayed at the end

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Python fundamentals
- Loops and conditions
- Random number generation
- Terminal-based game logic
